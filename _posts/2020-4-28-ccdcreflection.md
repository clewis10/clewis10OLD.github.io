# CCDC Reflection

### The Coliegate Cyber Defense Competition

After 4 years of competing in CCDC, I have gained many experiences and knowledge in handling of active incident response with attackers on our network. To give a brief explanation of the Colligate Cyber Defense Competition to those that might not know, it’s a competition that pits teams of 8 against each other to see who can maintain service uptime and business operations. The competition starts with a senecio where a mock company has been comprised and we must step in to handle the situation why professional penetration testers are attacking all the teams. This last year I got the opportunity to the team captain for Western although with the COVID situation the entire competition was significantly modified. With all that, I would like to reflect on the competition (wildcard vs previous years), important skills, recommendations for preparing and working as the captain. 

### The Competition

I want to with saying I absolutely love CCDC and it has taught me so much during my time at school, the experience from this is easily comparable to a class. Being able to apply directly what we study in school to practical use in the real world has been so helpful for me to cement my understanding along with giving me a sense of what I’m working towards. On top of all of that, there is a such a great opportunity to meet people in the industry which is immensely important. That summarizes many of the great aspects of CCDC but due to the COVID situation this year’s regionals for the west coast were head as part of their first ever wildcard event. The wildcard event was very different than a traditional CCDC competition and more in lines with a CTF competition. Still a lot of fun and pretty much delivered most of the same aspects of the normal competition. Although they didn’t do anything to help provide us with a means to network with anyone in the industry or much feed back about how we specifically did on the competition. This was the only part that was missing, we simply were told we place 3rd in our region without have much idea of how we did on the specific machines.

### Preparing to Compette

Getting ready for the competition must be given adequate time and it’s extremely important to make sure everyone on the team is doing their part. We head practices every week during fall and winter, ramping practices up as we got closer to the competition. On top of that everyone was supposed to be doing extra tasks individual, but I think I did a poor job of laying out expectations and requirements because it was clear not everyone stayed accountable. This was the hardest aspect of leadership to me because having to check in and check peoples work to make sure they were doing it felt odd to me, but it became easier through the school year.
